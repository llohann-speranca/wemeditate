      " It's okay to feel sad and depressed sometimes. It is important to recognize and accept these feelings and to take care of yourself. It is important to build a strong sense of self-love and self-worth. To do this, practice self-care activities and nurture your relationships with yourself and others. Additionally, try to focus on positive things and practice gratitude.\n",

      "\"The main point is to have faith in yourself. In this short time, I cannot tell you more than this but what I have to tell you that above all you jump into the ocean of joy. Happiness and unhappiness are the two sides of one coin. When your ego is pampered you feel happy.\"\n",
      "\"This is the first step of introspection. Now what helps for this introspection is your sense of love. Can you love a person who is distressful? One who is aggressive?\"\n",
      "\"What’s the use of feeling bad? Isn’t it? You must solve the problem. Not to feel sorry, but to do it.\"\n",
      "\"How can you be satisfied? Watch your mind, what it teaches you. Why does it make you cry? Just think of it.\"\n",
      "\"Spartan way and sometimes could be inconvenient to you. But I hope, you will go through all that, with joy and happiness, and will understand that that's the maximum one can do in a far-fetched places of this kind. The nature is surrounding you and nature is so beautiful and it sings the praise of God in every way - the leaves, the flowers, the trees, the ripples of the rivers - and the great mountains, like great Sahaja Yogis, are meditating and emitting vibrations all over. So one has to be more receptive than to be more complaining, should be more enjoying than feeling sad, should be one with Myself than with yourself in the sense that the Self that is within you is weak.\"\n",

      "\"On the contrary they wanted to improve it and work it out. But there’s a very simple way of doing it. You don’t have to go out of the way to change people or to make any sacrifices, nothing of the kind. Everybody today is suffering from some sort of anxiety, some sort of problems, some sort of worries.\"\n",
